OVERVIEW
	Feud is a 2 player turn based board game where your objective is to defeat your opponents army.
	There are two teams Black and White battling it out to be victorious. Each team starts with 8 pieces,
	consisting of 6 different types of pieces which are; archers, knights, kings, medics, wizards, and shields.

THE BOARD
	The board consists of a 4x4 grid where each tile is either occupied by a piece or is empty. Each tile has
	a label depending on the column and row it occupies (columns are from A-D and rows from 1-4). An occupied
	tile lists the piece's team (BLACK or WHITE), the piece's type, current hit points, and maximum hit points.
	Empty tiles are represented by dots (..... . . .). A tile is adjacent to another tile if it is exactly one
	tile up, down, left, or right from it. A piece is called active if one of it's adjacent tiles is on the 
	same team as it. An inactive piece is called isolated. When a piece's hit points reaches zero that tile
	becomes an empty tile.

PLAYING
	Each player's turn consists of two phases. First is the swap phase where a player must pick one of their
	active pieces and swap it with an adjacent piece (note you cannot swap with an empty tile however you can
	swap with an enemy piece).
	
	For example: BLACK has the following swaps avaliable in the above board:
			(A1 B1) (A1 A2) (A2 A3) (B1 C1) (C1 D1) (D1 D2)
	Note: The swap is entered by providing the two coordinates of the tiles to swap as follows; A1 A2
	Moreover, the order of the two coordinates do not matter so A1 A2 is equivalent to A2 A1.

	After swapping it is the player's action phase. During the action phase the player picks one of their
	active pieces and targets to perform actions on or skips their action phase. Each type of piece can 
	perform a different kind of action on one or more targets, each of the actions are listed in the next 
	section. In general actions damage enemy pieces or heal your pieces. Note a player that skips their
	action phase 3 turns in a row surrenders the game.

	Note: An action is entered by providing the tile of the piece to perform the action followed by the tile(s)
	of the target(s).

	For example in the above board state: C1 B1 D1
		would perform a medic action on the Black king at B1 and Black archer at D1

	A player wins the game if the enemy king reaches 0 hit points, all of the enemy pieces are isolated, or the
	enemy skips 3 action phases in a row.

	Note: A draw can occur if and only if a swap that isolates both teams at the same time is played.

PIECE ABILITIES
	The following lists what the action of each different type of piece is:
	- Archer (A): target 1 enemy piece on the same row or column and deal 1 damage to it.
	- Knight (N): target up to 2 enemy pieces that are adjacent and deal 1 damage to each of them.
	- King   (K): target 1 enempy piece that is adjacent and deal 1 damage to it.
	- Medic  (M): target up to 4 friendly adjacent pieces that are damaged and heal them for 1 point.
	- Wizard (W): target any other friendly piece on the board and swap tiles with it.
	- Shield (S): cannot perform an action however the enemy cannot swap places with it and enemy archers
		      cannot target pieces behind the shield.
